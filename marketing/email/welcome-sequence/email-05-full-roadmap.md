Hey,

You've been here for 10 days. Whether you've finished Module 0 or are still thinking about it, here's the full picture of what The AI-Native PM covers and where it's all going.

**The 5-module progression:**

**Module 0: Claude Code Basics (Free -- 20 min)**
Install Claude Code, learn 5 terminal commands, have your first AI conversation. This is the foundation everything else builds on.

**Module 1: PRD Generator (Free -- 30-45 min)**
Generate production-ready PRDs using 4 core techniques: context loading, iterative refinement, edge case extraction, and format control. Walk away with a real PRD you can use.

**Module 2: Rollout Plan Generator (Free)**
Turn a PRD into a phased rollout plan with milestones, risk flags, and team assignments. The natural next step after Module 1.

**Module 3: MCP Integrations (Free)**
Connect Claude Code to external tools -- Jira, Notion, databases. This is where workflows start to feel automated, not manual.

**Module 4: Vibe Code Real Projects ($29)**
Build functional internal tools and prototypes using Claude Code. No engineering background needed. Ship something real.

**The design is intentional:**

Modules 0 through 3 are free. You get real value -- real PRDs, real rollout plans, real integrations -- without paying anything. Module 4 is $29 for PMs who want to go further and build actual tools.

No upsell pressure. No gated content behind a paywall you didn't expect. You decide if and when you want to go deeper.

**My recommendation:** Start with Module 0 if you haven't. If you've done Module 0, go to Module 1. Each one builds on the last.
