# Module 3: Automate 5+ Hours of Weekly PM Busy Work

**Time:** 90 minutes (setup) + ongoing automation | **Prerequisites:** Modules 1–2 recommended, Google Workspace account | **Cost:** $39

> You didn't become a PM to copy-paste Jira ticket statuses into Google Docs. This module builds 3 production-ready MCP automations that handle the repetitive work so you can do the strategic work.

---

## Overview

Every PM has a dirty secret: 30–40% of their week is repetitive operations work. Status reports, sprint planning prep, meeting follow-up emails. It's necessary, but it's not what you were hired for.

This module teaches you to build MCP (Model Context Protocol) automations that connect Claude Code directly to your Google Workspace. Not theoretical automations — three specific, battle-tested workflows that save real hours starting Week 1.

## What You'll Build

| Automation | Time Saved | What It Replaces |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Sprint Planning Assistant | ~2 hrs/week | Manual Jira triage, spreadsheet wrangling, capacity math |
| Status Report Generator | ~1 hr/week | Copy-pasting from 5 tools into a Google Doc |
| Meeting Follow-Up Bot | ~30 min/meeting | Writing recap emails, extracting action items, setting reminders |

## The ROI Math

- **Time saved:** 5+ hours/week
- **At $50/hr PM rate:** $250/week, $13,000/year
- **Module cost:** $39
- **Payback period:** 1.2 days

## What is MCP (and Why Should PMs Care)?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is how Claude Code talks to external tools. Think of it as a universal adapter:

```
Claude Code ←→ MCP Server ←→ Google Docs, Sheets, Calendar, Gmail
```

Without MCP, you copy-paste data between tools. With MCP, Claude reads and writes directly to your workspace.

| Without MCP | With MCP |
|------------|----------|
| Open Jira → copy ticket titles → open Google Sheet → paste → format | "Generate this week's sprint plan from our Jira board" |
| Open 5 tabs → skim updates → write status doc → share | "Create this week's status report and share with the team" |
| Re-read meeting notes → extract action items → email attendees | "Send follow-ups from today's product review meeting" |

## What's Included After Purchase

- **3 production-ready MCP automations** (TypeScript, fully documented)
- **Step-by-step Google OAuth setup guide** (15 min)
- **MCP server with 5 tools** (plan_sprint, generate_status_report, draft_meeting_followup, and more)
- **Full EXPLAINER** with techniques, best practices, and troubleshooting
- **QUICKSTART guide** — working automations in 90 minutes
- **Private GitHub repo access** — clone and customize

## Preview: The Three Automations

### Sprint Planning Assistant
Reads your Jira/Linear board, analyzes team capacity, suggests sprint scope, and generates a sprint planning doc in Google Sheets. Replaces ~2 hours of Monday morning spreadsheet work.

### Status Report Generator
Pulls data from Jira, Google Docs, and Slack, then generates a formatted status report in Google Docs. What used to take an hour of copy-pasting is now one sentence.

### Meeting Follow-Up Bot
Takes meeting notes, extracts decisions and action items with owners, then drafts follow-up emails. No more "I'll send the recap later" that turns into "never."
