## Image

Clean graphic on a dark background (#111827) with brand blue accents (#2563EB). Title at the top in white bold text: "5 Terminal Commands Every PM Needs." Below, five rows, each showing a command in JetBrains Mono font on the left (brand blue color) and a one-word description on the right (white text):

1. `pwd` -- Where am I?
2. `ls` -- What's here?
3. `cd` -- Go somewhere
4. `cd ..` -- Go back
5. `mkdir` -- Make a folder

Each row has a subtle horizontal line separator. The bottom of the graphic has small text: "@ainativepm" in gray. Overall aesthetic: minimal, dark, developer-adjacent but approachable. No icons or illustrations -- text only for clarity.

## Caption

I'm a PM. A year ago I'd never opened a terminal. Now I use these 5 commands every day.

pwd -- shows your current location (like checking which folder you're in)
ls -- lists everything in that folder
cd -- moves you into a folder (cd Documents)
cd .. -- moves you back up one level
mkdir -- creates a new folder (mkdir my-project)

That's it. Five commands. You can learn them in under 5 minutes.

These are the foundation for using Claude Code, which runs in your terminal. Once you know these, you can navigate to any project folder and start having conversations with AI that actually touch your files.

No engineering background needed. No coding required.

Free 20-min course covers these commands plus your first AI conversation. Link in bio.
