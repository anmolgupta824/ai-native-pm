I spent 6 hours writing a PRD last month.

This week I wrote one in 45 minutes. Same quality. Better, actually.

Here's what changed.

**Before (6 hours):**
- Open blank Google Doc, stare at cursor
- Dig through 5 Slack channels for context
- Find the strategy doc from last quarter (where did I save it?)
- Write a first draft, realize I missed 3 edge cases
- Get review feedback: "What about the API constraints?"
- Rewrite two sections
- Final formatting pass

**After (45 minutes):**
- @-mention my strategy doc, user research, and API spec
- Claude Code asks me 15 clarifying questions before I write a word
- Questions like: "What happens if the payment fails mid-transaction?"
- Questions I would have missed until stakeholder review
- Generate a draft with full context already loaded
- Run a multi-perspective review: Engineer, VP Product, UX Researcher, QA Lead
- Each "reviewer" flags different gaps
- Polish and ship

The difference isn't AI writing the PRD for me.

It's AI asking the right questions before I write.

Socratic questioning. Multi-perspective review. Full context loading.

Three techniques. That's the entire workflow.

I packaged this into a free module. It drops next week.

Comment "PRD" if you want the link when it's live.
