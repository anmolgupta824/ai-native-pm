# Instagram Post: What Is Claude Code?

**Post #:** 1 of 6
**Timing:** Week 1 (after corresponding LinkedIn post)

## Image

Screenshot of a Claude Code terminal session on a dark theme background. The terminal shows a conversation where the user asks Claude to read a product strategy document and suggest improvements. Claude's response is visible, showing it reading the file contents and providing structured feedback with bullet points. The terminal font is JetBrains Mono. The top of the terminal shows the project folder path. Key elements visible: the `>` prompt where the user types, Claude's response with file read confirmation, and a few lines of actionable suggestions. The overall feel is clean, technical, and real -- not a mockup.

## Caption

This is what AI looks like when it actually works on your files.

Claude Code is a terminal-based AI assistant that reads, writes, and edits your actual project files. No copy-pasting into a chat window. No uploading PDFs and hoping for the best.

You type what you want in plain English. It reads your docs, creates files, runs commands, and connects to tools like Google Docs and Jira.

ChatGPT is a chat tool. Claude Code is a work tool.

That difference matters when you're trying to build real workflows -- not have a conversation about them.
