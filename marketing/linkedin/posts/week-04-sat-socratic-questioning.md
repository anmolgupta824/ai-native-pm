The best PRDs start with questions, not requirements.

Most PMs open a blank doc and start writing:

"The system shall..."
"Users should be able to..."
"The feature will support..."

They jump straight to solutions.

The best PRDs I've reviewed -- and the best ones I've written -- started with a conversation. Not with stakeholders. With the problem itself.

I call it Socratic Questioning for PRDs.

5 categories. One example each:

**Problem Clarity:**
"If we don't build this, what happens to users in 6 months?"

**Solution Validation:**
"What's the cheapest version of this that still solves the core problem?"

**Success Criteria:**
"If this ships and succeeds, what metric moved and by how much?"

**Constraints:**
"What technical, legal, or timeline constraints could kill this project?"

**Strategic Fit:**
"If our CEO asks why we built this instead of X, what's the answer?"

If you can't answer these clearly in conversation, you can't write them clearly in a PRD.

I've started running these 5 categories as a checklist before I draft anything. Sometimes with my team. Sometimes with AI. The output is always sharper.

The PRD isn't the hard part.

Thinking clearly about the problem is the hard part. The PRD is just the artifact.

Which question type does your team skip most? I'd bet it's Constraints.

**First Comment:** I built these 5 question categories into a free PRD Generator module. It uses Claude Code to run you through Socratic questioning before you write a single line. Launching next week -- follow for the link.
