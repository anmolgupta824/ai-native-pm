description: Generate daily standup update
---

Generate my daily standup update using this format:

**Yesterday:**
- List what was completed or progressed

**Today:**
- List what I plan to work on

**Blockers:**
- List any blockers or dependencies (or "None" if clear)

Keep each section to 3-5 bullet points max.
Use specific, concrete language — not vague statements like "worked on stuff."
Reference actual feature names, ticket numbers, or deliverables where possible.

Look at any recent files I've edited or created to figure out what I worked on.
