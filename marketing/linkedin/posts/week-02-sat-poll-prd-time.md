How long does it take you to write a PRD?

Be honest.

I tracked mine last quarter.

Average: 6 hours and 12 minutes per PRD.

That includes:
- Gathering context from 4-5 different docs
- Writing the first draft
- Realizing I missed edge cases
- Rewriting sections after stakeholder feedback
- Formatting and finalizing

The part that took the longest?
Not the writing. The context gathering.

Jumping between strategy docs, user research, past PRDs, Slack threads, and Jira tickets to piece together what I actually needed to write.

I've since cut that down to under an hour.

Not by writing faster. By loading context differently.

But I'm curious -- where do you land?

8+ hours

If you picked 4+ hours, I'd love to know: what section takes you the longest? Drop it in the comments.
