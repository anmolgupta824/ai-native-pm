# LinkedIn Post: Module 0 Launch -- Free 20-Minute Claude Code Course for PMs

**Week:** 3 | **Day:** Friday | **Type:** Launch announcement
**Goal:** Drive traffic to Module 0. First real CTA with a link. Position as zero-barrier entry point.

---

I built a free 20-minute course that teaches PMs to use Claude Code.

It's live now.

No signup. No email wall. No "join the waitlist."

Here's what you'll learn in 20 minutes:

1. How to install Claude Code (takes 3 minutes)
2. The only 5 terminal commands you need (pwd, ls, cd, cd .., mkdir)
3. The difference between "chat tools" and "work tools"
4. How to have your first real conversation with Claude Code
5. How to use @-mentions to point AI at your actual project files

By minute 20, you'll have Claude Code running on your machine.

No engineering experience needed. If you can open a laptop, you can do this.

Why I built this:

Every PM I talk to says the same thing -- "I know AI is important, but I don't know where to start."

The answer isn't another ChatGPT prompt template.

It's learning to use a tool that reads your files, writes documents, and connects to the tools you already use.

That's what Claude Code does. And that's what this course teaches.

This is Module 0 of The AI-Native PM. It's the starting point.
