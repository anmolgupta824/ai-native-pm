# Module 4: Ship Your First Prototype This Weekend

**Time:** 3–6 hours (one weekend) | **Prerequisites:** Claude Code installed, zero coding experience needed | **Cost:** $29

> The best way to understand engineering is to build something yourself. Not to become an engineer — but to become a PM who speaks their language and ships faster.

---

## Overview

"Vibe coding" means describing what you want in plain English and letting AI write the code. You don't need to know JavaScript, React, or databases. You need to know what you want to build and how to describe it clearly.

This module takes you through three progressive projects — from beginner to advanced — each deployed to a real production URL you can share with your team.

## Why PMs Should Vibe Code

| Reason | How It Helps |
|--------|-------------|
| **Speak engineering's language** | Understand why "it's a simple feature" takes 3 sprints |
| **Prototype faster** | Test ideas with users before writing a PRD |
| **Build internal tools** | Don't wait for eng to build your dashboard |
| **Career differentiation** | "PM who can ship prototypes" stands out in any interview |
| **Empathy** | Experience the build process → better collaboration |

## What You'll Build

| Project | Difficulty | Time | What You Get |
|---------|-----------|------|-------------|
| User Feedback Dashboard | Beginner | 1–2 hrs | Live dashboard to collect and view user feedback |
| A/B Test Calculator | Intermediate | 2–3 hrs | Statistical significance calculator with visualizations |
| Feature Flag Dashboard | Advanced | 3–4 hrs | Internal tool to manage feature rollouts |

Each project produces a **real, working app** deployed to a URL you can share.

## The PM Advantage

PMs are actually better at vibe coding than most engineers learning a new framework. Why? Because vibe coding is about **describing requirements clearly** — and that's literally your job.

| Skill | How PMs Already Have It |
|-------|----------------------|
| Clear requirements | You write user stories and acceptance criteria every day |
| User empathy | You know what the end user needs |
| Prioritization | You know what to build first and what to skip |
| Feedback loops | You're used to iterating based on user input |

## What's Included After Purchase

- **3 progressive project templates** with full conversation flows
- **Vibe coding copilot MCP agent** — guides you through each build
- **Coding 101 for PMs primer** — 5 concepts, not a CS degree
- **Prompting cheat sheet** — copy-paste prompts for common tasks
- **Full EXPLAINER** with techniques, best practices, troubleshooting
- **Deploy guides** — ship to a real URL on Vercel (free tier)
- **Private GitHub repo access** — clone and customize

## Preview: The Three Projects

### Project 1: User Feedback Dashboard (Beginner)
A web app where users submit feedback and you view it in a dashboard with filtering and analytics. Your first full-stack app in 1–2 hours.

### Project 2: A/B Test Calculator (Intermediate)
A statistical significance calculator for A/B tests. Input control and variant metrics, get a clear yes/no with confidence intervals. Makes you self-sufficient with experiment data.

### Project 3: Feature Flag Dashboard (Advanced)
An internal tool to manage feature flag rollouts. Create flags, set rollout percentages, target user segments, and track changes. Your own LaunchDarkly-lite.
