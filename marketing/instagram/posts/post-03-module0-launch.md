## Image

Screenshot of the ai-native-pm.vercel.app/modules/0-claude-basics page in a browser. The screenshot shows the hero section with the Module 0 badge, "Free" badge, and "20 min" badge. The title "Your First 20 Minutes with Claude Code" is visible in large text with the gradient blue styling. Below, the "Get Started" button and "Download from GitHub" button are visible. The browser tab shows the page title. The screenshot is clean, full-width, and shows the page as it appears on desktop. If possible, include a thin brand-blue border around the screenshot for visual framing.

Module 0 is live. Free.

Your First 20 Minutes with Claude Code -- a hands-on course built for PMs who have never opened a terminal.

What it covers:
-- How to install Claude Code (one command)
-- 5 terminal commands you'll actually use
-- Your first AI conversation that reads and writes real files
-- Key concepts: @-mentions, tools, MCP servers, project memory

20 minutes. Zero engineering experience needed. Completely free.

I built this because every AI course I found was either too technical or too theoretical. This one is practical. You'll have Claude Code running and working with your files before you finish.
