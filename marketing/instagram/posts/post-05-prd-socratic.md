# Instagram Post: PRD Socratic Questioning

**Post #:** 5 of 6
**Timing:** Week 5 (after corresponding LinkedIn post)

## Image

Screenshot of a Claude Code terminal session on a dark theme background showing a Socratic questioning flow. The terminal displays a back-and-forth conversation:

- User provides initial context: "I need to write a PRD for an in-app notifications center."
- Claude responds with a structured question: "Before we draft anything, let me understand the problem better. Who exactly is affected by the lack of notifications? How do you know this is a problem -- what data or user feedback supports it?"
- User answers with specific details (a few lines visible).
- Claude follows up with a deeper question about success metrics: "How will you measure whether this feature is working? What does failure look like?"

The conversation shows the natural Q&A rhythm -- Claude asking, the PM answering, Claude pushing deeper. The terminal font is JetBrains Mono. The exchange should feel authentic and mid-conversation, not scripted. About 8-12 lines visible total.

The best PRDs start with questions, not requirements.

Most PMs open a doc and start writing features. The PRD Generator flips that. It asks you questions first -- hard ones -- and uses your answers to generate the document.

This is called Socratic questioning. Claude pushes you across 5 categories:

Problem Clarity -- Who is affected? How do you know this is real?
Solution Validation -- What alternatives exist? Why this approach?
Success Criteria -- How will you measure it? What does failure look like?
Constraints -- What can't change? What dependencies exist?
Strategic Fit -- How does this connect to OKRs? What are you saying no to?

If you can't answer a question clearly in conversation, you can't write it clearly in a PRD. The struggle is the point.

By the time you generate the document, all the hard thinking is done. The PRD writes itself from your answers.
