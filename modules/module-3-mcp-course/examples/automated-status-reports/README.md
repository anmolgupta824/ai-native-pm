# Automated Status Reports

Pull data from Jira, Google Sheets, and Slack to generate a weekly status report automatically. No more Monday morning scrambles copy-pasting from five different tabs.

## What This Example Will Cover

- Connecting multiple MCP servers in a single workflow
- Aggregating sprint data from Jira (velocity, burndown, blockers)
- Pulling KPI actuals from Google Sheets
- Formatting a status report ready to paste into Slack or email
- Scheduling the workflow to run on a cadence

## Status

Coming in Phase 2. This example will be built after the core Jira and Google Sheets templates are finalized.
