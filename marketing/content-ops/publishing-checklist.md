# Publishing Checklist

Use this checklist before posting any content on any channel.

## Content Quality
- [ ] Follows **Hook → Proof → Solution → CTA** formula
- [ ] Hook is specific and relatable (not generic)
- [ ] Contains real data, personal experience, or screenshots as proof
- [ ] Solution is actionable (reader can do something after reading)
- [ ] Single, clear CTA (not multiple competing links)

## Brand Voice
- [ ] Uses approved words: build, ship, automate, workflow, practical, hands-on, real-world
- [ ] Avoids banned words: revolutionary, game-changing, disruptive, simple, easy, just
- [ ] Honest about limitations (what AI can and can't do)
- [ ] Authentic to Anmol's voice (Careem/Visa context, payments references where relevant)
- [ ] Not generic AI influencer tone

## CTA & Links
- [ ] CTA links to specific module page on theainativepm.com (not homepage)
- [ ] LinkedIn posts: link goes in **first comment**, not post body
- [ ] Instagram posts: CTA says "link in bio"
- [ ] Medium articles: inline links to module pages

## Formatting
- [ ] Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- [ ] Line breaks between sections
- [ ] Mobile-friendly (no wide tables or long unbroken text)
- [ ] Emojis used sparingly (1-2 max per post, none in Medium)

## Channel-Specific
### LinkedIn
- [ ] First line is the hook (visible before "see more")
- [ ] Under 1,300 characters for optimal reach (or 3,000 max for long-form)

### Instagram
- [ ] Caption under 2,200 characters
- [ ] Image/screenshot described in the post file
- [ ] 15-20 relevant hashtags
