No text, no labels — just the visual concept.
```

**Variables:**
- `ABSTRACT CONCEPT`: e.g., "data flowing between connected systems", "team collaboration across time zones"
- `INDUSTRY`: e.g., "fintech", "healthcare", "SaaS"
- `VISUAL METAPHOR`: e.g., "Glowing data streams connecting floating device icons in a network pattern"
- `ART STYLE`: e.g., "Minimal flat", "Isometric 3D", "Gradient abstract"
- `COLOR PALETTE`: e.g., "Blue and purple gradient on dark background"

**Recommended settings:**
- Style: `presentation`

## Template 4: Process / Flow Diagram Visual

```
A visual representation of a [NUMBER]-step process for [PROCESS NAME].
[NUMBER] distinct [SHAPE] arranged [LAYOUT] with [CONNECTOR] between them.
Each [SHAPE] uses a slightly different shade of [COLOR].
Clean, minimal design on [BACKGROUND]. Professional and clear.
No text inside the shapes — the visual shows the flow structure only.
```

**Variables:**
- `NUMBER`: How many steps (3-5 works best)
- `PROCESS NAME`: What process you're visualizing
- `SHAPE`: "circles", "rounded rectangles", "hexagons"
- `LAYOUT`: "left to right", "in a circle", "top to bottom"

## Tips for Better Presentation Visuals

1. **Always say "no text"** — DALL-E renders text poorly; add text in your slide tool
2. **Leave space for overlays** — Ask for "open space in center" or "clean margins"
3. **Match your deck's palette** — Specify exact colors to stay on-brand
4. **Use landscape format** — 1792x1024 matches standard 16:9 slide ratios
5. **Keep it simple** — One visual idea per image; complexity looks cluttered on slides
