I need to write a PRD for: $ARGUMENTS

Before writing anything, ask me these questions one at a time:

1. Who is the target user for this feature?
2. What problem does it solve?
3. What does success look like? (metrics)
4. Are there any technical constraints I should know about?
5. What's the timeline?

After I answer all 5, write the PRD with these sections:
- Overview (2-3 sentences)
- Problem Statement
- Target Users
- Requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Success Metrics
- Timeline & Milestones
- Open Questions

Format as markdown. Use bullet points, not paragraphs.
