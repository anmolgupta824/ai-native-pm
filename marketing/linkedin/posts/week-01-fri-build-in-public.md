I've been a PM for 7 years.

Payments at Visa. Fintech at Careem (Uber's Middle East arm). Products serving 50M customers. $120M/month in transactions.

And I still spent 6+ hours writing a single PRD last month.

Here's what frustrated me:

I've tried every AI tool.
ChatGPT. Claude. Gemini. Copilot.

They're all great at brainstorming.
But none of them actually fit into how I work.

I'd copy-paste context into a chat window.
Lose my conversation history.
Start over every Monday.

The problem isn't the AI.
It's that most PMs are using chat tools when they need work tools.

So I'm building something.

A practical, hands-on program that teaches PMs to use AI the way developers already do -- connected to your actual files, your real projects, your existing workflows.

Not theory. Not "10 prompts to be more productive."

Real techniques I use every week at work:
- Loading full project context in seconds
- Getting AI to ask ME the hard questions before I write
- Running multi-perspective reviews (engineer, VP, UX, QA) on a draft

4 modules. First two are free.

I'm calling it The AI-Native PM.

I'll be sharing the build process here -- what works, what doesn't, and what I learn along the way.

Follow along if you're a PM who wants to ship faster without waiting for engineering to build you a tool.

Who else is tired of copy-pasting into ChatGPT?
