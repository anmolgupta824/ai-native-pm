5 PRD mistakes I stopped making after building an AI assistant.

I've written hundreds of PRDs across Visa, Careem, and three other companies.

These mistakes showed up in almost every one.

**1. Starting with requirements instead of the problem.**
I used to jump straight to "the system shall..."
Now I force a 15-minute problem exploration before writing a single requirement.

**2. Vague success metrics.**
"Improve engagement" is not a metric.
"Increase 24-hour notification read rate from 45% to 80%" is.

**3. Only one approach considered.**
Stakeholders always ask "did you consider...?"
Now I generate 2-3 strategic approaches before committing to one.

**4. Edge cases found in review, not in writing.**
Engineers would flag gaps I missed. Every time.
Now I run edge case analysis before anyone else sees the doc.

**5. One perspective: mine.**
A PRD reviewed only by its author is a PRD with blind spots.
Now I run multi-perspective reviews -- engineer, exec, UX researcher, QA -- before sharing.

I built all 5 fixes into a free tool.

Which of these are you guilty of? Be honest.
