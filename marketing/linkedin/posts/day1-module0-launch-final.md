📉 6 hours to write a PRD → 50 minutes.

That's what happened when I stopped copy-pasting into ChatGPT and switched to a tool that actually reads my files.

I just turned my entire workflow into a free 20-minute course. It's live now. 🚀

No signup. No email wall. No "join the waitlist."

Here's what you'll learn in 20 minutes ⏱️

1️⃣ How to install Claude Code (takes 3 minutes)
2️⃣ The only 5 terminal commands you need (pwd, ls, cd, cd .., mkdir)
3️⃣ The difference between "chat tools" and "work tools"
4️⃣ How to have your first real conversation with Claude Code
5️⃣ How to use @-mentions to point AI at your actual project files

By minute 20, you'll have Claude Code running on your machine. 💻

No engineering experience needed. If you can open a laptop, you can do this.

Why I built this 👇

Every PM I talk to says the same thing — "I know AI is important, but I don't know where to start."

The answer isn't another ChatGPT prompt template.

It's learning to use a tool that reads your files, writes documents, and connects to the tools you already use.

That's what Claude Code does. And that's what this course teaches.

This is Module 0 of **The AI-Native PM**. It's the starting point.
