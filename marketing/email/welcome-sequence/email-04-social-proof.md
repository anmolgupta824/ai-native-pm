Hey,

When I built the PRD Generator module, I expected people to talk about speed. "I wrote a PRD in 45 minutes" -- that kind of thing.

They do. But that's not what comes up the most.

Here's what I keep hearing:

> **"I didn't expect the questions to be the valuable part."**
> The prompts forced me to think through things I usually skip -- rollback plans, metric definitions, edge cases for international users. The PRD was better because I had to answer better questions.

> **"I thought this was about making Claude write for me. It's actually about making me think more clearly."**
> The output is a draft. But the process of getting there -- loading context, refining iteratively -- that changed how I approach product specs.

> **"I used the PRD in a real sprint planning meeting. No one knew it started as an AI draft."**
> That's the test. If your engineering team can't tell, the output is production-ready.

The insight that keeps coming back: AI-assisted PRDs aren't about faster typing. They're about better thinking. Claude surfaces the gaps in your reasoning before your team does.

That's the real value.
