## Impact Scale

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| **High** | Service outage, data loss, revenue impact, or security breach |
| **Medium** | Degraded experience, increased support load, or delayed timeline |
| **Low** | Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issues, or easily recoverable |

## Likelihood Scale

| Level | Definition |
|-------|-----------|
| **High** | Very likely to occur (>50% chance) |
| **Medium** | Possible (10-50% chance) |
| **Low** | Unlikely (<10% chance) |
