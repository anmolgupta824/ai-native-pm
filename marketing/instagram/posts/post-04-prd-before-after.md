## Image

Split graphic divided vertically into two halves.

LEFT SIDE ("Before") -- muted gray/red tones:
- Header: "BEFORE" in bold uppercase, gray text
- Large clock icon showing 6:00, with text "6 hours" beneath it
- Three bullet points with X marks (red/gray):
  - Blank page paralysis
  - Missed edge cases
  - Review meeting surprises
- Overall feel: dull, frustrated, heavy

RIGHT SIDE ("After") -- brand blue/green tones:
- Header: "AFTER" in bold uppercase, brand blue text
- Large clock icon showing 0:45, with text "45 min" beneath it
- Three bullet points with checkmarks (brand blue/green):
  - Full context loaded with @-mentions
  - AI-guided Socratic questions
  - Multi-perspective review built in
- Overall feel: clean, confident, sharp

The dividing line between halves is a thin vertical brand blue line. Bottom of graphic: "@ainativepm" in small gray text. Background: white or very light gray. Font: Inter for text, with bold numbers for the time callouts.

## Caption

My PRDs used to take 6 hours. Now they take 45 minutes.

Here's what changed:

Before, I'd stare at a blank page for an hour. Then write requirements from memory. Then get blindsided in the review meeting by edge cases I missed.

Now, I load full project context into Claude Code using @-mentions. It reads my product docs, research, and architecture -- then asks me the hard questions before I write a single requirement.

The Socratic questioning phase takes about 15 minutes. By the time I generate the PRD, all the thinking is already done. Then I run a multi-perspective review from engineering, exec, UX, and QA viewpoints -- before my actual review meeting.

Same quality. A fraction of the time. And fewer surprises from stakeholders.
