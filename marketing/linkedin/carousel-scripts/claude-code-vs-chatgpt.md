**Bullet points:**
- You upload files manually

## Slide 3 -- Embedded AI

**Label (top, small):** TYPE 2

**Headline:** Embedded AI

**Examples:** Notion AI | Google Duet | Copilot in Office

**Bullet points:**

**Bullet points:**
- Reads and writes your actual files
- Runs terminal commands
- Connects to Jira, Google Sheets, Confluence via MCP
- Remembers context per project

**Visual:** Icon of a wrench or terminal window. Blue accent on "Work Tools" heading. This slide should feel slightly more prominent (bolder border or subtle background shade) to signal this is the key insight.

| Feature | Chat Tools | Work Tools |
|---|---|---|
