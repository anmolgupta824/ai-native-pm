You need exactly 5 terminal commands to use Claude Code.

Not 50. Not 20. Five.

Here they are:

`pwd` -- "Where am I right now?" (prints your current folder)

`ls` -- "What's in this folder?" (lists files and folders)

`cd folder-name` -- "Go into this folder." (moves you forward)

`cd ..` -- "Go back one folder." (moves you up)

`mkdir folder-name` -- "Create a new folder." (makes a directory)

That's it.

Five commands. Everything else, Claude Code handles for you.

You don't need to learn bash scripting.
You don't need a CS degree.
You don't need to understand what "grep" means.

You need to know how to navigate to your project folder.
Claude Code does the rest.

I've watched PMs go from "I've never opened a terminal" to running Claude Code in under 20 minutes.

The barrier to using AI work tools isn't technical skill.

It's the assumption that you need technical skill.

Save this post. I'm dropping a free course next week that walks you through all of this step by step.
