# Email 3: The PRD Problem

**Send:** Day 4 after signup
**Subject:** 6 hours is too long for a PRD.
**Preview text:** Blank page. Missing edge cases. Inconsistent formatting. Sound familiar?

Hey,

You know the drill. You open a blank doc. You stare at it. You write a few sections. You realize you forgot the edge cases. You go back to the eng spec. You add more sections. You reformat everything. You share it for review, and someone asks about the one scenario you didn't cover.

Six hours later, you have a PRD that's decent but not great.

I used to do this every sprint. Now I don't.

**The before/after:**
- Before: 6 hours, blank-page anxiety, missed edge cases caught in review
- After: 45 minutes, structured output, edge cases surfaced by Claude before I even think of them

Module 1 teaches you four core techniques:

1. **Context Loading** -- feeding Claude your product context so it writes with specificity, not generic filler
2. **Iterative Refinement** -- turning a rough draft into a production-ready spec through targeted follow-ups
3. **Edge Case Extraction** -- prompting Claude to surface scenarios you'd normally miss
4. **Format Control** -- getting output that matches your team's PRD template, not Claude's default

The module takes 30-45 minutes. The PRD you walk away with is one you can actually put in front of your engineering team.

*P.S. This isn't about replacing your judgment. It's about spending your judgment on the decisions that matter -- not on formatting and section headers.*
