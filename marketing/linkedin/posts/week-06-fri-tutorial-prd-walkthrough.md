How I write PRDs in 45 minutes using Claude Code.

Full walkthrough. No fluff.

Last week I needed a PRD for an In-App Notifications Center at Careem. 50M users. Multiple notification types. Complex permissions model.

Old me: 6 hours minimum, spread across two days.

Here's exactly how it went with the PRD Generator:

**Step 1: Context Loading (2 min)**
I pointed Claude Code at my project folder using @-mentions. Existing specs, API docs, user research -- all loaded in seconds. No copy-pasting into a chat window.

**Step 2: Socratic Exploration (15 min)**
Instead of writing, I answered questions. Claude asked things like "What happens when a user has 200+ unread notifications?" and "How does this interact with your existing push notification system?"

Questions I hadn't thought about. In minute 15, not in the engineering review.

**Step 3: Approach Generation (10 min)**
Three distinct approaches generated. Not variations of the same idea -- fundamentally different architectural strategies. I picked one and explained why.

**Step 4: PRD Generation (5 min)**
Full PRD drafted from the Socratic exploration and chosen approach. User stories, technical requirements, edge cases, success metrics. All grounded in the context I loaded in Step 1.

**Step 5: Multi-Perspective Review (10 min)**
This is the part that changed my process forever. Four reviews in 10 minutes:
- Engineer: flagged a database scaling concern
- VP Product: questioned the metric definition
- UX Researcher: spotted an accessibility gap in the notification tray
- QA Lead: identified 3 untested edge cases

**Step 6: Validation & Export (3 min)**
Final check, format cleanup, exported to markdown.

Total: 45 minutes. One sitting. No context switching.

The PRD wasn't perfect -- they never are. But it covered ground that used to take me days to think through.

The biggest shift wasn't speed. It was catching blind spots before my team did.
