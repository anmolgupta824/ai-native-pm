## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Headline:**
5 PRD Mistakes
I Stopped Making
with AI

**Subtext:**
And the fix for each one.

**Visual:** Clean typography on white. Blue accent bar at top. "The AI-Native PM" logo/name bottom-right.

## Slide 2: Mistake 1

**Mistake:**
Starting with requirements instead of the problem.

**The pattern:**
You open a blank doc and write "The system shall..."
before you've pressure-tested what you're actually solving.

**The fix:**
Use Socratic questioning to sharpen the problem first.
Spend 15 minutes answering hard questions before writing a single requirement.

Ask: "What happens if we don't build this?" If the answer is vague, you're not ready to write.

**Visual:** Red "X" icon next to the mistake. Green checkmark next to the fix. Clear two-section layout.

## Slide 3: Mistake 2

**Mistake:**
Vague success metrics.

**The pattern:**
"Improve user engagement."
"Reduce churn."
"Better onboarding experience."

None of these are measurable. None are falsifiable.

**The fix:**
Force specific numbers with a baseline and target.

Not "improve engagement"
but "increase 24-hour notification read rate from 45% to 80%."

If you can't put a number on it, you can't track whether you shipped the right thing.

**Visual:** Strikethrough on vague metrics. Bold highlight on the specific metric example.

## Slide 4: Mistake 3

**Mistake:**
Only one approach considered.

**The pattern:**
You think of a solution. It sounds right. You write the PRD around it.
Then a stakeholder asks "did you consider doing X instead?"
And you realize you never explored alternatives.

**The fix:**
Generate 2-3 strategic approaches before committing.

Force yourself to articulate why you chose Approach A over B and C.
Your stakeholders will ask anyway. Have the answer ready.

**Visual:** Single path icon (mistake) vs. branching paths icon (fix).

---

## Slide 5: Mistake 4

**Mistake:**
Edge cases found in review, not in writing.

**The pattern:**
You submit the PRD.
An engineer reads it and asks:
"What happens when the user has 500 unread notifications?"
"What if the API times out mid-transaction?"
"What about users on the old app version?"

You didn't think of these. Now you're rewriting.

**The fix:**
Run edge case analysis before anyone else sees the doc.

Systematically walk through error states, scale limits, backward compatibility, and permission boundaries before you share.

**Visual:** Chat bubble with question marks (mistake) vs. checklist with checkmarks (fix).

---

## Slide 6: Mistake 5

**Mistake:**
One perspective: yours.

**The pattern:**
You wrote it. You reviewed it. You think it's solid.
But you're a PM. You think like a PM.

Engineers see technical risk you missed.
Execs see strategic misalignment.
UX researchers see usability gaps.
QA sees untested paths.

**The fix:**
Run multi-perspective reviews before sharing.

Get feedback from four lenses:
- Engineer: technical feasibility and risk
- VP Product: strategic alignment and priority
- UX Researcher: usability and accessibility
- QA Lead: testability and edge cases

10 minutes. Four perspectives. Blind spots caught before your team meeting.

**Visual:** Single eye icon (mistake) vs. four different eye/lens icons (fix).
