# Module 0: Claude Code for PMs

**From zero to power user.**

## Part 1: Basics (20 minutes)

A lightweight introduction for Product Managers who have never used Claude Code. By the end, you'll have Claude Code installed, understand how it works, and be ready to start generating real PM outputs.

### Who This Is For

- Anyone who wants a guided intro before diving into the PRD Generator (Module 1)
- People who learn better with a walkthrough than a docs page

### What You'll Learn

1. What Claude Code is (and isn't)
2. How to install it (Mac, Windows, Linux)
3. The terminal basics you need (and nothing more)
4. Your first conversation with Claude Code
5. Key concepts: @-mentions, tools, MCP servers

### Who This Is For
