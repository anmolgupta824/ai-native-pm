# Value Proposition

## The AI-Native PM

### One-liner
Build AI-powered PM workflows in 30 minutes.

### Elevator Pitch
Practical, hands-on modules that teach Product Managers to use Claude Code. Start with a free PRD generator, then unlock automations that save 5+ hours per week. No engineering degree required.

### For Who
Product Managers who are curious about AI but haven't found a practical way to use it in their daily work.

### Key Benefits
1. **Immediate value** - Generate a real PRD in your first 30 minutes
2. **Practical, not theoretical** - Every module gives you tools you'll use Monday morning
3. **Progressive complexity** - Start free, advance to automations and coding
4. **Built for PMs** - Not generic AI courses - workflows designed for product work

### Differentiators
- Only PM-specific Claude Code curriculum
- MCP-based trainer agents (not just videos)
- Production-ready outputs (not toy demos)
- Free to start, pay only when you see the value

### Pricing Justification
If each module saves 5 hours/week at $50/hr average PM rate:
- Weekly value: $250
- Monthly value: $1,000
- Annual value: $13,000
- Cost: $99 (Pro Bundle)
- ROI: 13,000% in year one
