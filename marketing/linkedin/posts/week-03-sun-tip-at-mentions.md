The most underrated Claude Code feature for PMs:

@-mentions.

Here's how it works.

Instead of copy-pasting your strategy doc into ChatGPT, you type this in Claude Code:

"@product-strategy.md @user-research-q4.md -- Write a PRD for a notifications center that aligns with our Q1 priorities."

That's it.

Claude Code reads both files. Understands your strategy. Knows your research findings. Then writes with full context.

No copy-paste.
No "here's some background" preamble.
No 4,000-word prompt you spent 20 minutes assembling.

You just point at the files and tell it what to do.

Why this matters:

The #1 reason AI output feels generic is lack of context.

When you paste a paragraph of background into ChatGPT, the AI gets a paragraph of context.

When you @-mention your actual files, the AI gets everything. Strategy. Research. Metrics. Constraints. Prior decisions.

The output is night and day different.

I've started @-mentioning 3-4 files before every major writing task. PRDs, stakeholder updates, sprint planning notes.

The quality gap between "AI with context" and "AI without context" is massive.
