Hey,

I hear this a lot: "I'm a PM, not an engineer. The terminal isn't for me."

I get it. But here's the thing -- you don't need to learn "the terminal." You need five commands:

1. `pwd` -- shows where you are
2. `ls` -- shows what's in the folder
3. `cd` -- moves into a folder
4. `cd ..` -- moves back up
5. `mkdir` -- creates a new folder

That's it. Those five commands plus Claude Code, and you're building PM workflows that used to take hours.

No one's asking you to become a developer. You're still doing product work. You're doing it with better tools.
