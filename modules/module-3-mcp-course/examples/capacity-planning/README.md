# Capacity Planning

Combine Jira sprint data with team availability in Google Sheets to forecast whether your team can hit the next milestone. Spot overcommitment before it becomes a missed deadline.

## What This Example Will Cover

- Pulling sprint velocity and backlog size from Jira
- Reading team capacity and PTO data from Google Sheets
- Calculating realistic delivery estimates per sprint
- Flagging at-risk milestones based on current velocity vs. remaining work
- Generating a capacity summary for stakeholder reviews

## Status

Coming in Phase 2. This example will be built after the Jira and Google Sheets MCP templates are finalized.
