# Lesson 5: Polish & Export

**Time:** ~10 minutes
**Goal:** Final validation, review your progress, export the finished PRD.

---

## Section 1: Final Validation

**Exercise:** Run `validate_prd` (or `validate_prd_file`) on your current PRD one last time.

**Goal:** Grade A (90%+) or a strong B (85%+).

If you're below that:
- Check the "missing" list — are there quick wins you can add in 2 minutes?
- A single sentence mentioning the right concepts (e.g., "Timeline: Target launch Q2 2026") can close a gap
- Don't over-engineer it — a PRD is a living document, not a final exam

---

## Section 2: Compare Your Journey

Let's look at how far your PRD has come:

**Ask Claude to compare the drafts:**
- Read `output/prd-draft-lesson-1.md` (your v0.1 skeleton)
- Read the current draft
- Highlight 3 specific improvements

Typical progression:
- **Lesson 1:** Grade C/D — first full draft from your answers
- **Lesson 2:** Grade B- — deeper sections, alternative approaches added
- **Lesson 3:** Grade B/B+ — edge cases, validation gaps fixed
- **Lesson 4:** Grade A-/A — stakeholder concerns addressed
- **Now:** Grade A — polished, reviewed, ready to share

> **Teaching moment:** This progression mirrors how real PRDs evolve. Nobody writes an A-grade PRD in one pass. The best PMs iterate — draft, context, deepen, validate, review, polish.

## Section 3: Export

**Auto-save** the final version to `output/prd-final.md`.

**To use your PRD in other tools:**

| Destination | How to Get It There |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Google Docs** | Copy the markdown, paste into Docs (or use a Markdown-to-Docs converter) |
| **Notion** | Paste markdown directly — Notion renders it natively |
| **Confluence** | Use the markdown macro or paste and format |
| **Jira** | Link to the PRD doc from your Jira epic |
| **Sharing** | The file is at `output/prd-final.md` — share it however you normally share docs |

## Section 4: Course Complete

Congratulations — you've completed Module 1: PRD Generator.

**What you built:**
- A complete PRD using a structured template
- Enriched with context from reference documents
- Deepened with Socratic questioning and alternative approaches
- Validated with automated scoring
- Reviewed by simulated stakeholder perspectives
- Polished and exported as a ready-to-share document

**What's next:**
- **Module 2: Rollout Plan Generator** — Turn your PRD into a phased rollout plan with timelines, milestones, and risk mitigations
- **Module 3: MCP Automation** — Connect Claude to your real tools (Jira, Google Sheets, Google Drive) for automated PM workflows
- **Module 4: Image Generation** — Create product mockups and diagrams with AI

Your PRD is saved at `output/prd-final.md`. You can re-run any lesson to iterate further, or start a fresh PRD anytime using the tools in usage mode.
