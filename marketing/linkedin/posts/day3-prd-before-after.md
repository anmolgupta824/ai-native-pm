📝 I used to spend 6 hours writing a PRD.

Now it takes 50 minutes. Here's exactly what changed.

**Before (the old way):**

😩 Open Google Doc
😩 Stare at blank page for 20 minutes
😩 Write the first draft in 3 hours
😩 Send to engineering lead
😩 Get 15 comments about missing edge cases
😩 Spend 2 more hours revising
😩 Repeat once more

**After (with Claude Code):**

✅ Point AI at my strategy doc, user research, and tech constraints
✅ AI asks ME 15 questions about edge cases before writing anything
✅ First draft lands in 50 minutes
✅ Engineering review comes back with minor edits only

The difference isn't the AI writing faster. It's the AI *thinking* before writing. 🧠

Most PMs use AI like a fast typist — "write me a PRD for feature X."

I use it like a senior PM who's been on the team for 6 months. It reads my actual files. It knows my product context. It challenges my assumptions before drafting anything.

The secret? **Socratic questioning.** 🤔

Instead of "generate a PRD," I tell Claude Code:

*"Read these 4 documents. Then ask me every question you'd need answered before writing a production-ready PRD. Don't write anything until we've covered scope, edge cases, success metrics, and dependencies."*

15 questions later, the PRD practically writes itself — and it's better than what I'd have written solo.
