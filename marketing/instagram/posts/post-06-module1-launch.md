The Module 0 prerequisite banner ("New to Claude Code? Start with Module 0") is visible at the top. The browser tab shows the page title. Screenshot is clean, full-width, desktop view.

## Caption

Module 1 is live. The PRD Generator. Free.

This module teaches you to write production-ready PRDs with AI -- not by having AI write them for you, but by using AI to think better before you write.

Two ways to use it:

Teacher Mode -- A 6-lesson interactive course. Exercises, quizzes, and hands-on practice. No prior knowledge needed.

Usage Mode -- 6 production-ready MCP tools. Load context, answer questions, generate and validate PRDs immediately.

The 4 core techniques:
1. Full context loading via @-mentions
2. Socratic questioning to sharpen your thinking
3. Multiple strategic approaches before committing
4. Multi-perspective feedback (engineering, exec, UX, QA)

Free. No signup. No paywall.

If you haven't used Claude Code before, start with Module 0 first (also free, 20 min). Link in bio.
