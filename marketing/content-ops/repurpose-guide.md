# Content Repurposing Guide

## The Flow

Every piece of content starts on LinkedIn and gets adapted for other channels.

```
LinkedIn Post (origin)
    ↓
    ├── → Medium Article (expand if topic has depth + engagement)
    ├── → Instagram Photo Post (extract key visual + compress caption)
    ├── → Email Newsletter (best post of the week → "One Practical Tip")
    └── → Substack Notes (cross-post LinkedIn text directly)
```

## LinkedIn → Medium

**When to expand:** If a LinkedIn post gets 50+ reactions or 10+ comments, and the topic has depth worth exploring.

**How:**
1. Take the LinkedIn hook as the article introduction
2. Expand each point into a full section (2-3 paragraphs each)
3. Add personal stories from Careem/Visa experience
4. Include comparison tables, code examples, or screenshots
5. Add SEO-friendly title and subtitle
6. End with CTA to specific module

**Target:** 1,500-2,000 words. Aim for 7-10 minute read time.

## LinkedIn → Instagram

**When to adapt:** Every LinkedIn post should be evaluated for Instagram potential.

**How:**
1. Extract the core insight or data point
2. Create or screenshot a visual (Claude Code terminal, comparison table, stat graphic)
3. Compress the LinkedIn text into an Instagram caption (under 2,200 chars)
4. Add 15-20 hashtags from the hashtag bank below
5. CTA becomes "link in bio"

**Instagram Hashtag Bank:**
```
#ProductManager #ProductManagement #PM #PMLife
#AI #AITools #ArtificialIntelligence #AIForPMs
#ClaudeCode #Claude #Anthropic
#PRD #ProductRequirements #ProductStrategy
#TechLeadership #ProductLeadership #PMTips
#Fintech #Payments #StartupLife
#CareerGrowth #PMSkills #ProductOps
#Automation #Workflow #Productivity
```

Pick 15-20 per post. Mix broad (#AI) with niche (#ProductManager).

## LinkedIn → Email Newsletter

**When:** Every Thursday, pick the best LinkedIn post from that week.

**How:**
1. The core insight becomes the "One Practical Tip" section
2. Condense to 150-200 words max
3. Add a "try this" action step
4. Link to the original LinkedIn post for those who want the full version

## LinkedIn → Substack Notes

**When:** Cross-post every LinkedIn post to Substack Notes.

**How:**
1. Copy the LinkedIn text as-is
2. Add the module link directly in the Note (not in comments)
3. Post within 24 hours of the LinkedIn post

## Batching Strategy

**Saturday content creation block (2-3 hours):**
1. Write the next week's LinkedIn posts (1-2 posts, ~30 min)
2. Adapt for Instagram if applicable (~20 min)
3. Draft the Thursday newsletter (~20 min)
4. Cross-post to Substack Notes (~5 min)
5. Queue Medium article if one is in progress (~60 min)

**Total weekly time commitment: 2-3 hours on Saturday**
