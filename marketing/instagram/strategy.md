# Instagram Strategy

## Purpose

Instagram is a **secondary channel** for brand awareness and reaching younger/aspiring PMs. LinkedIn is the primary conversion channel. Instagram builds visual brand presence and captures an audience that's less active on LinkedIn.

## Content Format: Photo Posts

Start with photo posts (screenshots + captions). Each post includes:
1. **Image** — screenshot of Claude Code in action, stat graphic, or comparison visual
2. **Caption** — valuable insight with Hook → Proof → Solution → CTA format
3. **Hashtags** — 15-20 per post, mix of broad and niche

## Posting Cadence

**1 post per week** (aligned with LinkedIn content, posted 1-2 days after LinkedIn version).

## Content Pillars

| Pillar | % | Example |
|--------|---|---------|
| Educational | 50% | "5 terminal commands every PM needs" with screenshot |
| Before/After | 25% | "6 hrs → 45 min PRD" with comparison graphic |
| Launch/Announcement | 15% | "Free AI course for PMs is live" with website screenshot |
| Community | 10% | Polls in Stories, Q&A |

## What Works on PM Instagram

1. **Screenshots of tools in action** — Claude Code terminal, PRD outputs, before/after
2. **Stat graphics** — "6 hours → 45 minutes" with bold numbers
3. **Comparison visuals** — Chat tool vs Work tool side-by-side
4. **Quote cards** — Key insights from module content
5. **Behind-the-scenes** — Building the course, testing modules

## What Doesn't Work

- Long text-heavy carousels (save those for LinkedIn)
- Generic AI hype posts
- Stock photos
- Overly polished corporate content

## Design Guidelines

- Use brand colors: Primary Blue (#2563EB), Dark (#1D4ED8), White
- Font: Inter for text, JetBrains Mono for code/terminal
- Clean, minimal layouts (Stripe/Linear aesthetic)
- Screenshots should show real Claude Code output, not mockups
- Dark terminal theme for screenshots (more visually striking)

## Hashtag Strategy

**Always use (core):**
#ProductManager #PM #AITools #ClaudeCode #ProductManagement

**Rotate (topic-specific):**
- Module 0: #Terminal #CodingForPMs #LearnAI #TechSkills
- Module 1: #PRD #ProductRequirements #ProductStrategy #PMWorkflow
- General: #AI #Automation #Productivity #CareerGrowth #Fintech #PMTips

**Target:** 15-20 hashtags per post, placed at the end of the caption.

## Future Evolution

Once the account has 500+ followers, consider adding:
- **Reels** — screen recordings with voiceover (sped-up demos)
- **Stories** — polls, Q&A, behind-the-scenes
- **Collaborations** — guest posts with other PM creators
