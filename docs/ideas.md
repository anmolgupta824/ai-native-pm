## Ideas for PAID Modules

### 5. Module 5: Claude Code Hooks & Automation ($29-39)
- **What:** Teach PMs to set up automation hooks (scripts that fire before/after Claude actions)

  - Auto-format PRDs to company template after generation
  - Auto-save outputs to Google Drive after every session
  - Pre-load context from Jira before starting work
  - Notification hooks (Slack message when PRD is done)
- **Why paid:** Advanced, high value, saves recurring time
- **Effort:** Medium (need to build hook templates)

### 6. Module 6: Sub-Agents & Parallel Workflows ($29-39)
- **What:** Teach PMs to spin up multiple Claude instances for parallel work
- **PM use cases:**
  - Research 5 competitors simultaneously
  - Generate PRD + rollout plan + stakeholder email in parallel
  - Sprint planning: one agent analyzes velocity, another drafts stories
  - Multi-market launch: agents handle different regions simultaneously
- **Why paid:** Power-user feature, massive time savings
- **Effort:** Medium

### 7. Module 7: Custom Skills for PMs ($29-39)
- **What:** Create reusable "skills" (saved workflows) for common PM tasks
- **PM use cases:**
  - "/standup" — auto-generates daily standup from Jira + Sheets
  - "/prd" — launches PRD workflow with company template
  - "/retro" — pulls sprint data and generates retro doc

- **PM use cases:**
  - Scrape competitor pricing pages automatically
  - Monitor competitor feature releases

## Competitive Positioning

**Nick Saraev:** Dev/freelancer audience → "Build & Sell AI services"
**Our course:** PM audience → "Be 10x more productive at your PM job"

**Our unique advantages:**
1. PM-specific workflows (PRDs, rollout plans, sprint management)
2. Deeper MCP integrations (7-lesson course vs. brief mention)
3. Non-coder friendly (no terminal fear, no code shown)
4. Tool-specific (Google Workspace, Jira, Figma — PM daily tools)

**His advantage over us:**
1. Deployment & hosting (not relevant for PMs)
2. Sub-agents & advanced features (we should add this)
3. Business/monetization angle (different audience)
4. 268K subscribers (massive reach)
