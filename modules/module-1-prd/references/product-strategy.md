## Product Principles

1. **Speed over perfection** — Ship fast, iterate based on data
2. **Simple by default, powerful when needed** — Progressive disclosure
3. **Team-first, not individual-first** — Features should benefit the team, not just one person
4. **Data-informed, not data-driven** — Numbers guide decisions, but user empathy leads
5. **Integrate, don't replicate** — Connect with tools teams already use

## Strategic Bets for 2026

### Bet 1: Real-Time Collaboration
**Thesis:** Teams are moving from async to real-time. Adding live cursors, co-editing, and instant updates will increase daily engagement by 40%.
**Investment:** 2 engineers, 1 designer for Q1-Q2.
**Risk:** Performance at scale with 50+ concurrent editors.

### Bet 2: AI-Powered Workflows
**Thesis:** AI can automate 60% of repetitive PM tasks (status updates, sprint summaries, risk flagging). This differentiates us from legacy tools.
**Investment:** 1 ML engineer, 1 product engineer for Q2-Q3.
**Risk:** User trust in AI-generated content; accuracy of suggestions.

### Bet 3: Self-Serve Analytics
**Thesis:** Team leads want to understand velocity, bottlenecks, and team health without asking for reports. A built-in analytics dashboard reduces churn by giving leaders visibility.
**Investment:** 1 full-stack engineer, 1 data engineer for Q1.
**Risk:** Data privacy concerns; dashboard performance with large datasets.

## Target Market

**Primary:** Software development teams, 10-50 people
**Secondary:** Product & design teams, 5-30 people
**Emerging:** Cross-functional project teams (marketing, ops), 10-100 people

**ICP (Ideal Customer Profile):**
- B2B SaaS companies, Series A to Series C
- Engineering-led organizations
- Currently using Jira (too complex) or Notion (not structured enough)
- Budget: $8-15/user/month

| Asana | Broad use cases, marketing teams | Expensive at scale, slow | Performance, pricing |
| Notion | Flexible, docs + tasks | No real project management structure | Structured workflows |
