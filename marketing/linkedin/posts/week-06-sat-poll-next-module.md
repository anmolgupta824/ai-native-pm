What should I build next?

Two modules are live and free:
- Module 0: Claude Code Basics (15-min setup)
- Module 1: PRD Generator (45-min PRDs with 4 core techniques)

Module 2 (AI Image Generation) is live.

After that, I want to build what you actually need.

Here's what I'm considering:

Poll:
(a) Competitive analysis automation
(b) Sprint planning automation
(c) User research synthesis
(d) Status report automation

I've felt the pain of all four. But I can only build one next.

Vote above and tell me in the comments:

What PM workflow eats the most hours in your week?

Not "what sounds cool." What actually drains your time?
