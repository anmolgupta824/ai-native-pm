## Tips for Better Mockups

1. **Be specific about UI elements** — "3 cards" is better than "some cards"
2. **Mention layout** — "sidebar on left, content on right" guides composition
3. **Include data examples** — "showing $12,450 revenue" adds realism
4. **Specify the device** — "iPhone-style" vs "web browser" sets expectations
5. **Keep colors simple** — 2-3 colors max for clean mockups
