💻 Every PM I've shown Claude Code to asks the same thing:

"Wait... I need to use the terminal?"

Yes. And you need exactly 5 commands:

`pwd` → "Where am I?"
`ls` → "What's in this folder?"
`cd foldername` → "Go into this folder"
`cd ..` → "Go back"
`mkdir name` → "Create a new folder"

That's it. That's the entire technical prerequisite. 🤯

I have a CS degree and these are the same 5 commands I use 90% of the time.

The terminal isn't the point — it's the doorway to using AI on your actual work files instead of copy-pasting into ChatGPT.

Once you know these 5, you can:

→ Navigate to any project folder
→ Launch Claude Code with full file context
→ Have AI read your docs, write PRDs, pull from Jira

The PMs who learn this now will have a 2-year head start. ⚡
