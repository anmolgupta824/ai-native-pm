# Design-to-Jira Pipeline

Take a Figma design file and automatically generate Jira tickets for each component, screen, or user flow. Bridge the gap between design handoff and engineering backlog creation.

## What This Example Will Cover

- Reading component and frame data from Figma via MCP
- Mapping design screens to user stories and tasks
- Batch-creating Jira issues with descriptions linked to Figma frames
- Estimating scope based on component complexity
- Maintaining traceability between designs and tickets

## Status

Coming in Phase 2. This example will be built after the Jira and Figma MCP templates are finalized.
