## What You'll Build

By Lesson 8, you'll have a complete PM workspace:

```
pm-workspace/
  CLAUDE.md                    ← Your project brain
  sprint-goals.md              ← Current sprint context
  .claude/
    settings.json              ← Hooks (auto-format, protect files)
    skills/
      standup/SKILL.md         ← /standup command
      prd/SKILL.md             ← /prd [feature] command
      status/SKILL.md          ← /status command
      retro/SKILL.md           ← /retro command
  templates/                   ← PRD, one-pager, status templates
  docs/                        ← Generated outputs
```

## Before vs. After

### Before This Module

- Re-explain context every session
- Write the same prompts over and over
- Outputs get worse the longer you chat
- One task at a time, sequentially

### After This Module

- Claude knows your context automatically
- Type `/prd` and get a full workflow
- Clean sessions, sharp outputs every time
- 5 tasks in parallel with sub-agents

---

## Teaching Method

This module uses a **teacher brain** (CLAUDE.md) to deliver lessons interactively.

When you open the folder in Claude Code and say "start":
- ✅ Lessons are delivered section-by-section (not all at once)
- ✅ Each section has interactive exercises you do RIGHT NOW
- ✅ Claude guides you through, checks your work, answers questions
- ✅ Everything stays in one session (no "open a new terminal" nonsense)
- ✅ You build real files and skills you'll actually use

---

## Who This Is For

- PMs who completed Module 0 (or already know Claude Code basics)
- PMs who want to 10x their productivity with Claude Code
- Anyone building an AI-powered PM workspace
- PMs learning to code with AI instead of coding traditional ways

---

## What's Next?

After Module 0B, explore the advanced modules:

## FAQ

**Q: Can I skip lessons?**
A: Not recommended. Each lesson builds on the previous one. But Lessons 5+ are somewhat independent — you can skip to Lesson 5 (Skills) if you want to focus on that.

**Q: Do I need Claude Pro?**
A: Yes. Claude Haiku won't work for this course — you need Pro or Max for full Claude Code access.

**Q: How long does it actually take?**
A: 2-3 hours if you work straight through. Most people spread it over 2-3 days (30 min per day).

**Q: Can I save my progress?**
A: Yes! Each lesson completion is tracked in `progress.json`. When you close and reopen the module, you'll pick up where you left off.

**Q: What if I mess up a lesson?**
A: No problem. Just delete the file or folder and start the lesson again. The teacher will guide you through.
