# LinkedIn Post: The PRD Generator Is Live

**Week:** 5 | **Day:** Friday | **Type:** Launch Announcement
**Goal:** Drive traffic to Module 1. Establish credibility with specifics. Convert followers into users.

The PRD Generator is live. Free. No signup.

I spent 6 months building this because I was tired of spending 6 hours on every PRD.

Now it takes me 45 minutes. Here's what's inside:

A hands-on course + production tools built on Claude Code.

Two paths depending on where you are:

**Teacher Mode** (2-3 hours)
6 interactive lessons that teach you 4 core techniques:
- Full Context loading (your real files, not copy-paste)
- Socratic Questioning (AI asks YOU the hard questions)
- Multiple Approaches (never commit to one path too early)
- Multi-Perspective Review (engineer, VP, UX researcher, QA)

**Usage Mode** (5 min to first output)
6 MCP tools that plug into your existing workflow.
Load context. Generate PRDs. Run reviews. Export.

3 templates included: Feature Launch, API Integration, Redesign.

I built this from real work -- payments products at Careem serving 50M customers.

Not theory. Not a prompt library. A workflow you can use on Monday.

Two paths: Learn first or build immediately. Both free.

Link in comments. Start with Module 0 if you haven't installed Claude Code yet.
