3 types of AI tools exist today.

Most PMs only know 2.

Here's the breakdown:

**Type 1: Chat tools**
Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini.
You upload files. You type prompts. You get answers.
Great for brainstorming, summarizing, drafting.
But every conversation starts from scratch.

**Type 2: Embedded AI**
Notion AI, Google Duet, Copilot in Office.
Built into apps you already use.
Helpful, but limited to what that app can do.

**Type 3: Work tools**
Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf.
These operate directly on your files.
They read your docs. Write outputs. Run commands.
They connect to Jira, Google Sheets, and Confluence via MCP.
They remember context per project -- not per conversation.

Here's why this matters for PMs:

Chat tools help you think.
Work tools help you ship.

Most PMs stop at Type 1.
They copy-paste requirements into ChatGPT and wonder why it feels shallow.

The PMs who are actually saving hours?
They're using Type 3 -- pointed at their real strategy docs, real user research, real project context.

I made a carousel that breaks this down visually (swipe through it).
