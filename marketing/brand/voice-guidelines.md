# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Brand: The AI-Native PM

### Voice Characteristics

**Practical, not preachy.** We teach by showing, not lecturing. Every piece of content should leave the reader with something they can use today.

**Technical but accessible.** We bridge PM and engineering. We explain MCP servers without assuming CS knowledge, and we talk about product strategy without dumbing it down.

**Honest about limitations.** AI isn't magic. We're upfront about what Claude Code can and can't do. This builds trust and sets realistic expectations.

**Human and relatable.** We share failures, not just wins. We admit when something is hard. We celebrate small victories.

### Tone by Channel

| Channel | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| LinkedIn | Professional but conversational | "I spent 8 hours on PRDs last week. This week? 1 hour. Here's what changed." |
| Medium/Blog | Educational, narrative-driven | Deep dives with personal stories woven in |
| Email | Direct, value-first | "Here's what you get: [value]. Here's how: [link]." |
| GitHub README | Clear, scannable, beginner-friendly | Step-by-step, no assumptions about skill level |

### Words We Use
- Build, ship, automate, workflow, practical, hands-on, real-world
- "In 30 minutes" (specificity builds trust)
- "Production-ready" (not toy demos)

### Words We Avoid
- "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "disruptive" (too much hype)
- "Simple" or "easy" (might not be easy for everyone)
- "Just" (dismissive - "just install Node" assumes too much)
- Jargon without explanation

### Content Formula
1. **Hook:** A specific, relatable problem
2. **Proof:** Data, screenshots, or personal experience
3. **Solution:** Step-by-step, actionable
4. **CTA:** One clear next step
